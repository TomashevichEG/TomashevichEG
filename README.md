**TomashevichEG/TomashevichEG** is a ‚ú® _special_ ‚ú® repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working at one of the largest banks in Russia, holding a Senior Data Scientist position;
üå± I‚Äôm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Management at the Russian Gubkin State University;
üëØ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on startups, innovative projects in Data Science and Machine Learning;
ü§î I'm conducting research to predict energy consumption in the global market using economic data;
üí¨ Ask me about machine learning, data analysis, SQL, Python, and my projects in NLP and predictive modeling;
üì´ How to reach me: @grinef.

Programming Languages:

Python, SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
Data Analysis & Visualization:

pandas, numpy, statsmodels, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, Power BI, Yandex DataLens
Experience in large-scale data analysis, ad-hoc analytics, and building comprehensive dashboards for business decision-making.
Machine Learning:
